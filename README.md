# advent-of-code

A collection of my solution to the 2021 Advent of Code challenge. 


### lib
- inputParser.ts: Formats the input, trims the input and removes empty characters
- createChallengeDirectory.ts: Bootstraps a directory for a new challenge. The created directory is prefilled with an index.ts, challenge1.ts, challenge2.ts, input.txt and the necessary imports between all these are wired together.
